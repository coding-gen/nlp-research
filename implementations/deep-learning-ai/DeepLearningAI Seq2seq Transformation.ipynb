       "\n",
       "As an adult, I can attest that pandas are not just for kids. That's why I got </span>this <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;\">adorable panda plushie </span>for my <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;\">daughter for her birthday cuz </span><span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;\">daughter's birthday, after </span>she <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;\">keeps taking \n",
       "</span><span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;\">kept taking </span>mine from my <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;\">room.  Yes, adults also like pandas too.  </span><span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;\">room. And let me tell you, it was a hit! </span>She <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;\">takes \n",
       "</span><span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;\">takes </span>it everywhere with her, and <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;\">it's super </span><span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;\">I can see why. The plushie is incredibly </span>soft and <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;\">cute.  One </span><span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;\">cute, with a design that captures the essence </span>of <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;\">the \n",
       "</span><span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;\">a real panda.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, I did notice that one of the </span>ears is a bit lower than the other, <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;\">and </span><span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;\">which </span>I don't think <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;\">that was \n",
       "designed to be asymmetrical. </span><span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;\">was intentional. </span>It's <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;\">a minor flaw, but worth mentioning. Additionally, I do think the plushie is </span>a bit small for <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;\">what I paid for it \n",
       "though. </span><span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;\">the price I paid. While I love the quality and design, </span>I think there might be other options <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;\">out there </span>that are bigger <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;\">for \n",
       "</span><span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;\">for </span>the same <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;\">price.  It </span><span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;\">price.\n",
       "\n",
       "That being said, I was pleasantly surprised when the plushie </span>arrived a day earlier than <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;\">expected, so I got \n",
       "to play </span><span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;\">expected. I couldn't resist playing </span>with it myself before <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;\">I gave </span><span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;\">giving </span>it to my <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;\">daughter.\n",
       "</span><span style=\"color:red;font-weight:700;\">daughter. Overall, I highly recommend this panda plushie for anyone who loves cute and cuddly things. It's perfect for kids and adults alike, and despite its minor flaws, it's definitely worth the investment.</span>"
